  * \brief Worker threadpool example for threaded masked occlusion culling.
  *
  * This class implements a threadpool for occluder rendering. Calls to CullingThreadpool::RenderTriangle()
  * will immediately return, after adding work items to a queue, and occluder rendering is performed
  * by worker threads as quickly as possible. Occlusion queries are performed directly on the calling 
  * threadand can be performed either synchronosly, by calling Flush() before executing the query, or 
  * asynchronosly, by performing the query without waiting for the worker threads to finish. 
  *
  * Note that this implementation should be considered an example rather than the best threading
  * solution. You may want to integrate threading in your own task system, and it may also be beneficial 
  * to thread the traversal code. Refer to MaskedOcclusionCulling::BinTriangles() and 
  * MaskedOcclusionCulling::RenderTrilist() for functions that can be used to make your own 
  * threaded culling system.

	 * \brief Creates a new threadpool for masked occlusion culling. This object has a

	 *        rendering asynchronously on worker threads (similar to how DX/GL works). 
	 *
	 * \param numThreads Number of worker threads to perform occluder rendering. Best 
	 *        balance may be scene/machine dependent, but it's good practice to leave at 
	 *        least one full core (2 threads with hyperthreading) for the main thread.
	 * \param binsW The screen is divided into binsW x binsH rectangular bins for load
	 *        balancing. The number of bins should be atleast equal to the number of
	 *        worker threads.
	 * \param binsH See description for the binsW parameter.
	 * \param maxJobs Maximum number of jobs that may be in flight at any given time. If
	 *        the caller thread generates jobs faster than the worker threads can finish
	 *        them, then the job queue will fill up and the caller thread will stall once
	 *        "maxJobs" items have been queued up. For culling systems interleaving occlusion 
	 *        queries and rendering, this value should be kept quite low to minimize false
	 *        positives (see TestRect()). We've observed that 32 [default] items typically
	 *        works well for our interleaved queries, while also allowing good load-balancing,
	 *        and this is the recommended setting.
